I create web applications for the Internet and mobile platforms. Both in the front-end and in the back-end. Specialised in **JavaScript, Vue, React, Node.js**, TypeScript and modern front-end.

My name is **Steven**, an full stack web developer located in China. Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great.

My passion is to creat *the best for the web*, and to always keep up with the latest technologies and trends.

In a nutshell: **I create simple solutions to complex problems.**

**What I AM GOOD AT**

The main value I provide is that I can take a **complex subject** and turn it into something **understandable.** This way even starting programmers can follow what the complex parts of your product are doing.

I love **sharing my knowlege** and like to **teach and mentor developers** while I work on projects. This way the team I am working with will get a bit of my experience transferred to them.

My belief is that I **bring more value** to the product if I teach my ways to the current development team.
